Project Description
1. For this second project, your task will be to "tell a story" through data visualizations. 
2. Unlike the first project, where you focused on using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in "report form", this project should be more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 
3. Just as with the first project, you will be asked to conduct a 10 minute presentation that lays out your theme, coding approach, data munging techniques, and final visualization.
4. You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly. The universe is wide and expansive. Don't limit yourself to what you know. 
5. You will have roughly two weeks to complete this project.

Specific Requirements
1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least onedatabase (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.) 2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: • A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)
• A combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
• A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data
• A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)
3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover. 4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records. 5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.)
6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views

Weekly Schedule
End-of-Class Tuesday April 24: You will need to create a 1 page proposal. The proposal should include: • A brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale • A link to your dataset(s) and a screenshot of the metadata if it exists. • 3-4 screenshots of relevant "inspiring" visualizations that frame your creative fodder • A sketch of the final design • A link to the primary GitHub repository you'll be housing your work in

One Last Thought!
• Project week is a great, great time to tie up loose ends both with your group and on your own.
• If there are topics you’d like to review, shoot me and the TAs a message. We’re happy to do extra review sessions for small groups during these weeks.
